# ROS2 3D attractor

This package implements a [force field] that functions like an [attractor], to 
pull a robotic end effector toward some point, line, or plane in 3D space.

See the [system model](doc/markdown/spring_damper.md) documentation for an 
overview of the equations that define the attractor. See the 
[configuration](doc/markdown/configuration.md) documentation for information 
about configuring the parameters for the attractor. Also see the notes about 
[system stability](doc/markdown/stability.md) and relevant 
[Force Dimension examples](doc/markdown/force_dimension.md) for further 
information.

[Installation documentation](doc/markdown/installation.md) forthcoming.
